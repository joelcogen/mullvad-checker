# Mullvad Checker

A simple tray icon indicator of your Mullvad connection status, with DNS leak check.

I wrote this because I connect to Mullvad on my router and I wanted a simple way to know if the connection is up without going to the website.

If you have the Mullvad app installed, it will also check the time left on your account.
